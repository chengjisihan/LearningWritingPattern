learning writing patter  首先需要把新闻进行分类（文本分类），提取出主题为stock的新闻，然后summary它的主要趋势，形成一篇归纳性质的文章。重点在于学习
金融新闻的写作风格，提取它在用词和句法结构方面的特征。
问题分解：
1、首先得把📰分类，找出描述股票变化的entry（文本分类，类似于情感分析，可用卷积神经网络来实现）
2、然后提取its writing style in vocabulary and sentence structure perspectives.这一部分，可以用类似于NMT的技术来实现，因为也是sequence to 
sequence的模型。涉及到的技术：GRU,Stacked Bidirectional RNN, Encoder and Decoder using RNN, 注意力机制，柱搜索算法，softmax）但是需要改造
已有模型来适应此项目的需求。

Natural language generation(NLG)

NLG major concerns:acquiring content selection rules using machine learning(content determination)
The core of the research is the measurement of the variation of a language model generated through the clustering
Traditional approach of NLG is knowledge domain based, but arrival of machine learning has called brings NLG to a new area
 It is clear that in this method content classification is deliberated as a problem of collective classification which provides a broader view of the data instead of deep analysis
 Portet et al. [64] show empir- ical formulation of pattern mining which is developed as a part of BT-45, a system that provides summaries based on a neonatal intensive care unit
 Rule base and Heuristic search is also helpful for content determination
 Employing rules in content selection is also a common 
 Task was more clearly focused on Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples which isused extensively by semantic web
 Document structuring:turning the selected content to a more structured format:group, order, relate
 Most early systems utilized Attribute Value Matrices(AVM) to do it, later based on tuples of values
 Lexicalization? coarse grained lexicalization or fine grained lexicalization(deep analysis
 Portet et al. [64] show empir- ical formulation of pattern mining which is developed as a part of BT-45, a system that provides summaries based on a neonatal intensive care unit
Rule Based Lexicalization  Less human invlove Addressing this gap, Reiter et al. [66] present an interesting model which relies on consistent set of data-to-word rules.
Lexicalization Using Case Based Reasoning(CBR)
Aggregation We may need syntactic embedding to generating description of stock trends
Trainable approaches: ranking functions/surpervised learning approach Main difference lies in the way that text is fed, Barzilay and Lapata [8] use clustered text and Walker et al. [83] use raw text.
Evolutionary Algorithms for Aggregation  fitness function involved(GP)In terms of the process and evaluation, genetic algorithm brought by this has considerable similarity with model described by Herv ́as and Gerv ́as [37].
